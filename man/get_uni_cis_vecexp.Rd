Description
1- Select SNPs that were associated with any exposure (using a P-value threshold â‰¤ 5 x 10-8) in at least one of the XXX studies, in the gene region.
2- For each protein select the lead variant among the SNPs that were selected at step 1. Alternatively, by setting default_param$minpval1 to FALSE
the function will conduct linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping for the instruments with the TwoSampleMR R package to identify independent pQTLs for each protein. The funcyion uses r2< 0.001 as the threshold to exclude dependent pQTLs in the gene region.
